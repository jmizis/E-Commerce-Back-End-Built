# E-Commerce-Back-End-Built

## Description

In this assignment I needed to modify starter code in three different folders. First I had to fill out the models that went with the seeding information, secondly I had to work on the routes. This was the biggest part of our assignment. Not all the routes were given to us so I had to go through every single one to figure it out. Once all my routes were connected I open up Insomnia to run my code. In Insomnia I was able to receive the seeded information, able to create new seed, update it, and delete it. I created a walkthrough video below of me going throught Insomnia. 




## Video 

For this assignment we had to create a walkthrough video that demonstrated our command-line application. I used the app Screencastify to create my video. Below you can watch the video.

## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push.




## Conclusion

This challenge was tougher than the previous ones but it's a great way to show off our newly learned skills to be able to build the back end of the server. We showed off our skill of creating the models to match up with the seed data. We also filled in the code for the routes. This took time with a lot of thinking but I'm happy I was able to complete the assignment!
